        <p><strong>There are four (4) simple steps to achieving your goal and getting support for your cause:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
        	<li>Setup a Fundraiser: Starting a fundraising campaign requires courage and determination to get solution to a challenging need. MobiTrust is here to support you all the way and make the ride easier and memorable. Our advice is that you write a brief but compelling story of the situation you are faced with. Ensure that you are specific about how much money is required, what the money will be used for and how the money will be dispensed to make an impact in your life or the life of your loved one.<br /><br />
            You will be required to answer some questions and enter some details about yourself, the fundraising cause and who you are raising money for. Once these are done, you can click on the submit button and your Fundraising campaign will become active.<br /><br />
            Note that MobiTrust validates the cases you put up and would terminate your fundraiser if confirmed to be invalid. For such occurrences, MobiTrust will solicit the suggestions of online communities to decide which existing fundraisers to transfer the funds to.<br /><br />
            Be sure to have the consent and information of the beneficiary. You will need to enter the amount you intend to raise and an appropriate end date for the campaign. Good photos and videos can be uploaded also. You can visit our <a href="#" class="page-link">Fundraising Suggestions</a> page for more ideas for your fundraising campaign.<br /><br />
            <strong>The fundraising team will be made up of the following:</strong><br /><br />
            <u>Lead Supporter:</u> This is the person who sets up and runs the fundraising campaign on behalf of the beneficiary.<br /><br />
            Supporters: These are the people who help share the details and assist with soliciting for support for the fundraising cause through all possible media; social media and otherwise. Supporters are able to add photos; post updates, and share the fundraiser with their friends, email contacts and social media networks.<br /><br />
            Adding just one supporter can increase your fundraising page views by a great percentage. And do not forget to add the beneficiary of the fundraiser as a supporter also; this will greatly help the fundraising cause.<br /><br />
            <u>Fund manager:</u> This is the person assigned to control the money from the fundraising campaign. This person must be a Nigerian.<br /><br />
            <u>Guidance personnel:</u> This is the person that will be assigned by MobiTrust to a fundraising campaign to offer advice and guidance on the best practises to get the most from the campaign. This person is ready at all times to respond through email and phone calls.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Spread the word to family, friends and to the world:</strong> The impact and result of your fundraising campaign will be largely based on the network and community of supporters that you garner. So be sure to spread the word about your cause early and consistently using friends and family members through email and social media: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google+, Instagram etc. You can visit our <a href="#" class="page-link">Leveraging Social Media</a> page for ideas to maximise social media in your fundraising campaign.<br /><br />
            It is important to also post updates of the case in order to keep people informed.<br /><br />
            MobiTrust offers mobile advantage, so donating to a cause can be as easy as dialling a code on a mobile phone and contributing using the phone credit. Card payment options are also available.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Get prayers, hugs and donations:</strong> In times of need, a simple prayer can offer hope and encouragement, a hug can signify that one is not alone and donations can provide for timely bill settlements that can progress the cause quicker towards accomplishing the goal. How and when the money should be dispersed will be chosen by the Fund manager, this way, the beneficiary will be able to get the help they need at the right time.<br /><br />
            Our payment method is quick and quite easy. We do charge a small fee in order to remain operational to offer you a good service. You can visit <a href="#" class="page-link">Our Fees</a> page to learn more about our fees.<br /><br />
            We are committed to sending you whatever you have raised, not considering the amount of your goal.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Contact our guidance personnel to guide you in making the best of your fundraising campaign:</strong> We understand that you may not know the best ways to promote and spread the word about your fundraising campaign; this is why we assign guidance personnel to each fundraising campaign. You will have someone to contact to ask questions and seek advice from, to make the best and reach a greater network of supporters for your campaign. They are ready at all times to assist you because they truly care about putting a smile on your face.</li>
