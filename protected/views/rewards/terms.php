                  Every action must be completed before the point is allocated
                  for the action. For example, if a visitor taps on the ‘Donate
                  Now’ button without completing the donation, the points will
                  not be allocated. Also, if a visitor taps on ‘Become a
                  Support’ button without registering as a supporter, the points
                  will not be allocated to the visitor.

                  All actions have unique number of points; some a high number
                  and some low, others have a very high number. The number of
                  points for each action however, will not be revealed. But as a
                  bonus, inviting a friend will offer a high number of points.

              <li>
                <p>
                  To invite a friend, a visitor will first become a supporter,
                  log into their dashboard, tap on the invite a friend link, and
                  invite friends by email or SMS. The points for inviting a
                  friend is low, but a very high point will only be allocated
                  when the invited friend makes a donation.
